## What is System Design?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves making decisions about the system's structure, how it interacts with other systems, and how it will scale to meet future needs. The goal of system design is to create an efficient, reliable, and maintainable system that meets both functional and non-functional requirements.
