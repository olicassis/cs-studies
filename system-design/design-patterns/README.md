## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They are proven strategies that provide templates for solving specific design challenges, improving code structure, maintainability, and scalability. Design patterns help developers avoid reinventing the wheel by providing best practices and standardized approaches to solving recurring design problems.
